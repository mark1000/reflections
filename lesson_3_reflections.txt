When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You can sync to multiple computers. Other people can make contributions.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you synced automatically, you might get public versions that don't run
or are incomplete in some way. With manual syncing, you can decide when to
publish a change, and decide when you're ready to see changes other people
have done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork: When you want to have a copy of the repository in your own github account.
Clone: When you want to copy the repository to your local machine.
Branch: When you want to make changes to the code without necessarily affecting the main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
